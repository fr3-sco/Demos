The exercises/assignments in this repository are the projects I've completing using Java & Python computer programming skills I've learned in Codedex, my bridge program & MS in data science program at Grand Canyon University.  

Exercise 1 
Write a java program that prompts the user to enter a 5-digit positive integer. Using only the / and % operations, compute each individual digit and display the sum of the digits. 

Exercise 2 
Write a java program that prompts the user to enter a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. Convert the temperature to degrees Celsius. Then, prompt the user to enter a temperature in Celsius. Convert the temperature to degrees Fahrenheit. 

Exercise 3 
This java program is a "guessing game" program. The program will generate a random integer between 1 and 10000, inclusive. The program should prompt the user to enter a guess. For each guess, the program will output 'HIGHER' if the user's guess is lower than the target, 'LOWER' if the user's guess is higher than the target, or 'WINNER' if the user guesses the target.

Exercise 4 
Write a java program for an organization that wishes to accept contributions until a total of $10,000,000 is met. Once this total is hit, no further contributions should be accepted. The organization wants the program to read data from an input file (input.in). The following data should be written to a file called results.out: 
- The total number of contributions needed to meet the goal of 10 million dollars.
- The amount of the largest and smallest contribution accepted.
- The average contribution size.
Consider both the scenario where the input file does not contain enough contributions to meet the goal and the scenario where the input file contains more data than needed.

Exercise 5 
Write a java program that reads text from a file. For each word in the file, output the original word and its encrypted equivalent in all-caps.
